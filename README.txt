RaiderReminder
Description:
	Our Project is an event reminder app that is meant to be easy to use for students at MTSU. 
	It is meant to help students organize their tasks neatly in one place that can always be easily accessed and receive reminders for your tasks and/or events. 
	All this to allow for better time management. 
	The app consists of 5 key sections. 
	First all the event data consists of Event name, Day, month, yeah, hour, minute, and location. 
	The first feature was the home page that allows one to quickly access the app and see the list of the events for today.
	Next was the calendar page which displayed a calendar layout with days cells that would display a star if events were in that day. 
	You could then click on a day to have a pop-up view of all the events for that day. 
	Next was the add page which allows the user to enter all the necessary data for the user to add an event.
	Next was the edit event page which is meant to allow the user to choose the events they want to delete and then delete them. 
	Finally, was the all events page which is meant to allow the user to quickly scroll through all the events to look for something. 
Installation:
	First make sure that you have JDK for java installed and android studio installed, if not then install those. 
	Next you want to start the emulator in your device of choice and make sure it is running SDK 34. 
	Next you want to download and unzip the RaiderRemainder zip file. 
	You want to then add all those files to android studio and then you want to click make module in the top of android studio. 
	From there you should be able to start the emulator and then run the application. 

Usage:
	The Project is very simple to use. 
	The add page you simple add the name of the event first then the numeral day, the numeral month, year. 
	Then for time it needs to be entered in military time, which is out of 24 hours, for example 1pm is 13 hour and minutes remains the same. 
	Then finally enter the location. 
	Then hit the blue done button and the event will be added.
